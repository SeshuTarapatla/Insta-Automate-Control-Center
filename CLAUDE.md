# CLAUDE.md — Insta-Automate Control Center

Read this first, then [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). Current state: **Phases 0 and 1 complete** — CP 1.1 (config engine),
1.2 (config API), 1.3 (Limits UI + `config.env` quick-access bar) and 1.4 (Flows/Limits/Queue tabs
+ `GET /api/queue`) are committed and user-verified. `config.env` is now fully controllable from
the app, and the pipeline's own `Queue` class was run against an app-written `ENTITY_QUEUE` to
confirm it. Next up is **Phase 2 (Core services)**, starting at CP 2.1 — open a fresh session.

## What this project is

A Flutter Windows control center for `Insta-Automate`, a Prefect-based Instagram scraping
pipeline that drives a real Android phone over ADB, stores rows in Postgres and screenshots in
`IA_DIR`, and runs as two pods on local k3s (Rancher Desktop).

It ships as **two parts, both in this repo**:

- `app/` — the Flutter Windows client. Pubspec name `ia_control_center`, org `com.instaautomate`.
- `agent/` — `ia-agent`, a Python/FastAPI service that is the long-lived Windows process. It
  supervises the core services, serves the pods and the phone, and outlives the UI window.
  `uv` project; console script `ia-agent`; bearer token at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ia-agent\token`.

## The five repos in play

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `d:\Coding\Insta-Automate-Control-Center` | **this repo** — Flutter app + agent |
| `D:\Coding\Insta-Automate` | the pipeline: flows, tasks, controllers, `ia` CLI |
| `D:\Coding\wsl-bridge` | FastAPI scrcpy shim on `0.0.0.0:8000` — supervised, **not modified** |
| `D:\Coding\flutter\Insta-Automate-Client` | the existing Android review app (pubspec name `ia_manager`) |
| `D:\Coding\Helmcharts\Insta-Automate` | helm chart: `server.yaml` (scheduler) + `worker.yaml` |

Supporting: `D:\Coding\my-modules` (logger, postgres, kubernetes, scrcpy, win32, inet),
`D:\Coding\Prefect-K3S` (`prefect-k3s` CLI and the base image).

## Rules for working here

1. **Context and memory files live only in this repo.** `CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and everything
   under `docs/` — never anywhere else on the filesystem.
2. **Record decisions as they are made** in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and keep `CLAUDE.md` and the
   plan docs current within the session that changed them.
3. **Other repos are feature-branch only.** Everything outside this repo works today. Changes go
   on `feat/control-center` (or `feat/lan-agent` for the mobile client) and are **never merged**
   until the control center is accepted. Never commit to `main` in another repo.
4. **Build in phases, stop at checkpoints.** Each `CP` in the plan is a commit boundary with a
   manual test the user runs before moving on.
5. **The user drives the app, never you.** (EXPECTATION.md #8 — this is absolute.) Do **not**
   click, navigate, screenshot, or otherwise drive the Flutter app, and do not use the `run`
   skill's GUI-driving patterns on it. The laptop has a single screen with VS Code maximized, so
   automated window driving actively disrupts the user's workspace. What you may do: build it,
   `flutter analyze` it, start it, and then **stop and hand over** — say it's running and what to
   check. The user tests, kills it, and reports back. Backend pieces (the agent's REST/WS surface,
   `config.env` round-trips) you *should* still verify yourself with `curl`/scripts — the rule is
   about the GUI, not about skipping verification.
6. **Say when a session is done.** When a phase's goal is met, tell the user explicitly that the
   session's goal is complete and a fresh session should be opened.
7. **No compromise on UI/UX.** This is meant to feel like a mature control center, not a form
   over a config file — visually mature, with UI/UX decisions that make the app genuinely easier
   to use, not merely functional.

## Facts an implementer needs

Verified live on 2026-07-30.

**Endpoints**

```

pod → host  172.19.16.1  ==  host.docker.internal
```

**IA_DIR** = `C:\Users\seshu\Pictures\insta-automate`, hostPath-mounted into both IA pods at
`/insta-automate`. Paths that cross the pod↔host boundary must be **IA_DIR-relative**.

```
config.env                    switches + ENTITY_QUEUE + limits (live-read by flows)
entities/<id>.jpg             1080×2246  full profile page
scanned/<root>/<user>.jpg     1080×198   follower/like list row crop
gender_valid/  gender_invalid/            classify output, same row crops
scrape_queued/<root>/<user>.jpg           human-promoted from gender_valid
scraped/<root>/<user>.jpg     1080×~2000 dp + profile-header composite
follow_queued/<root>/<user>.jpg           human-promoted from scraped
```

**Flows** (`entity_ingest`, `entity_scan`, `entity_classify`, `entity_scrape`, `entity_follow`)
are deployed to Prefect work pool `insta-automate-pool` from the git repo. The trigger loops all
live in `Insta-Automate/src/insta_automate/controllers/prefect.py` — that one file holds every
hardcoded delay and gate.

**Two humans-in-the-loop steps** gate the pipeline: `gender_valid → scrape_queued` and
`scraped → follow_queued`. Today they only happen on the phone.

**Don't confuse** `entity_scan` (harvest usernames from a profile's followers/following or a
post's likers) with `entity_scrape` (open one profile and capture its stats). Different limits,
different images, different Instagram account used (`alt` for scrape, `main` for follow).

## Decisions already taken

Recorded in [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md):

1. Flutter UI + Python `ia-agent`, both in this repo. The agent, not the UI, owns process
   lifetime and becomes the Windows startup entry.
2. Flows get structured `emit()` events plus a filesystem watcher — not log scraping — because
   `entity_classify` and `entity_follow` delete images immediately after logging them.
3. Phone notifications over a LAN WebSocket held by an Android foreground service, with Telegram
   kept as the guaranteed fallback when nothing is listening.
4. The desktop app gets full image review/curation parity with the mobile app.
5. The desktop app's "Start agent" action uses raw Win32 `CreateProcess` (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW`) via
   `package:win32`, not `dart:io`'s `Process.start` — the latter flashes a visible console window
   because `uv`/`python` are console-subsystem executables and `dart:io` doesn't expose that flag.

---

## Open questions

Eleven of them, listed at the end of [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). None block Phase 0. The two
that need answers earliest are **Q1** (`ENTITY_QUEUE` is shared between the scrape and follow
queues — split it or not?) and **Q3** (are `PROFILES`/`REELS`/`POSTS` really the live scan caps?
the code says yes, the config comment says no).

---

## Security flag

`D:\Coding\Insta-Automate\Dockerfile` is committed and contains the Postgres password, the
Telegram bot token, and two Telethon session strings in plaintext — a session string is a full
account credential. `ia build` regenerates that file on every build, so it never needed to be
committed. See ARCHITECTURE §10; tracked as Q10.
